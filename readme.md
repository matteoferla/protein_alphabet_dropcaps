The protein alphabet is a series of protein structure views that look like letters compiled by Mark Howarth. This can be found [here](http://www.bioch.ox.ac.uk/howarth/alphabet.htm).
ïœ‚This css/js library makes use of it to make dropcaps.

## Use
To use it the js simply add `Alphabet_ray folder` and `protein_dropcaps.js` in your website directory and add `<script src="image_dropcaps.js"></script>` (or wherever you put it) somewhere (preferably bottommost of body).
The protein_dropcaps.js script is written lazily so uses a relative path that assumes `Alphabet_ray` is in the root directory. Therefore if you add the pngs to somewhere else


## Implementation
`p:first-child:first-letter`

## Coming up
I think a bunch of protein complexes throbbers (spinning things, like circle of balls or marble, that appear when you wait) would be fun.
